# Customer-Churn-Analysis
This project aims to analyze customer churn behavior for SABS Telecom, a leading telecommunications provider in California. Customer churn, the phenomenon where customers leave one service provider for another, is a critical issue in the highly competitive telecom industry. Reducing churn is essential because acquiring new customers is significantly more expensive than retaining existing ones, and a high churn rate can negatively impact both revenue and profitability.

The primary objective of this analysis is to identify the key factors contributing to customer churn, uncover patterns in customer behavior, and develop strategic recommendations to improve customer retention. The analysis is based on a dataset of 7,043 customers from 2022, containing a wide range of demographic, service usage, and payment information.

# Goals and Objectives
Identify Factors Influencing Churn: Using a comprehensive dataset, the project seeks to uncover the main factors that lead to customer churn, such as service type, contract duration, payment method, and customer tenure.
Develop Retention Strategies: By understanding why customers leave, we aim to provide actionable recommendations to help SABS Telecom retain more customers and reduce churn.
Enhance Customer Satisfaction: A loyal customer base not only brings consistent revenue but also acts as brand ambassadors. Improving customer satisfaction can reduce churn and drive long-term success.
Support Data-Driven Decision Making: The project provides key insights that will enable SABS Telecom to make informed, data-driven decisions to improve its service offerings and customer relationships.
# Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains detailed information about 7,043 customers from SABS Telecom, collected over a 12-month period in 2022. The key data features include:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, marital status, and geographic location.
Service Usage: Internet, phone, and TV subscription details, including contract type and service type (e.g., DSL, fiber optic).
Payment Information: Monthly charges, total charges, and payment methods (e.g., bank withdrawal, credit card, mailed check).
Customer Tenure: The number of months the customer has been with the company.
Churn Status: Whether the customer has left the service or remained.
# Approach and Methodology
We followed a 5-step data analysis approach for this project:

Define: We defined the business problem as customer churn, which directly affects revenue and profitability. Our goal was to uncover the drivers of churn.
Collect: The dataset was sourced internally from SABS Telecom and contained detailed information about customer demographics, service usage, and payment history.
Clean: Given that the dataset was already pre-cleaned, minimal cleaning was required. We performed minor adjustments to ensure data integrity and consistency.
Analyze: The analysis was conducted using Tableau to visualize key insights, including churn rates, retention rates, and customer lifetime value. We focused on identifying trends based on service usage patterns, payment methods, and contract types.
Present & Share: A Tableau dashboard was created to present the key findings and insights, focusing on KPIs such as churn rate by demographic, service type, and customer behavior.
Key Insights
# The analysis revealed several important insights:

1. High churn rates among month-to-month contract customers: Customers with short-term, month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn than those with one- or two-year contracts.
2. Payment Method Impact: Customers who paid via mailed checks or bank withdrawals had higher churn rates compared to those using credit cards.
3. Demographic Patterns: Non-married customers, younger customers, and those with lower tenure exhibited higher churn rates.
4. Internet Service Type: Customers using DSL internet services were more likely to churn than those using fiber optic services.
5. Customer Tenure: Newer customers (less than a year) had the highest churn rates, which suggests that early customer engagement and satisfaction are critical to retention.
Recommendations
# Based on the insights, the following recommendations were proposed:

1. Loyalty and Reward Programs: Implement targeted rewards for long-tenure customers and those with consistent payment records to incentivize retention.
2. Personalized Feedback and Engagement: For higher-risk groups (e.g., non-married customers, those using bank withdrawals), direct outreach and personalized feedback collection (e.g., phone calls) can help address concerns and improve satisfaction.
3. Competitor Strategy: Offer competitive service packages, such as better devices, faster internet speeds, and more data to retain customers tempted by competitor offers.
4. Targeted Marketing: Focus marketing efforts on regional areas and leverage social media and video ads to increase brand visibility.
5. Flexible Payment Options: Offer more flexible and affordable payment plans, particularly for younger customers or those with short tenures.
# Tools and Technologies
1. Tableau: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
2. Excel: Data inspection and initial exploration.

# Conclusion
This project provided valuable insights into customer churn behavior at SABS Telecom, identifying key drivers and proposing actionable recommendations to reduce churn. By implementing the recommended strategies, SABS Telecom can improve customer satisfaction, increase retention, and enhance overall business profitability.
